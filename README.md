# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use existing Citi Bike data from New York City in August to inform a possible bike-sharing business in Des Moines.  Using Tableau, we created a number of visualizations to help show user patterns and bike information that can help better visualize data.  This, in turn, can assist with decision making for this new business. 

## Results 

### Subscribers vs. Customers
Using a simple graph to illustrate User type, we see that Citi Bike has 4x as many Users who are Subscribers than simply Customers.  Creating a solid Subscriber base will be important when starting out in Des Moines.

### Start vs. End of Trip
By mapping starting and ending Station IDs, we see that most NYC trips start and end within Manhattan.  This could be due to the high number of tourists who use Citi Bike while in NYC.  However, we could also understand how bike-sharing would be an easier

### Note:  Due to the security issue with Tableau Public Desktop, I did all of the work in the web version.  There were some features, such as editing headers to show 12-hour time that I could not do on the web version.
